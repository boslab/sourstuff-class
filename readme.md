# Introduction

The current insight into the living stuff of cells is far past Anglo-Saxon times.
In fact, science grows so fast today that only Latin can keep up with all the new wisdom!
This is because you can take parts of Latin and Greek words and make endless new words.

Having so many words like this makes it possible study `bio` `mechanic` `immuno` `engineering`.
How about `chemo` `synth` `etic` `tissue` `re` `gener` `ation` `praxis`? ðŸ™ƒ
But where would we be without `micro` `liters`?
Most of our science is Latin and this is a good thing.


# Uncleftish Beholding

Poul Anderson's 1989 text is about if English chemistry developed along purely Germanic lines.
The Norman Conquest of 1066 brought high contact with French and Latin speakers and permanently changed the language.
Anglish is a tongue-in-cheek reconstructed dialect that points to English's Anglo-Saxon roots.

I have a pet `hypo` `thesis` that German did well and a science and philosophy language in earlier times:
the words are literal and it's like moving ideas around in physical space, easier to grasp.
You can taste the sourness of *Sauerstoff* (oxygen) and recall sauerkraut and vinegar when you say it.

Kids can learn biology from the special insights that Germanic words bring.
So let's look at the text and see what we can learn!


## The introductory spirit

> With the growth of worldken, we began to learn, and today we have a beholding of stuff and work that watching bears out, both in the workstead and in daily life.

Pursue your passions in science and do things that help your life.
In German, when you *kennen lernen,* it's usually in the `con` `text` of meeting a person.
That's not to say that *Wissenschaft* is lonely, because there's a society in it just like *Gesellschaft.*

Nature is wonderful and entertaining when you carefully observe it and behold the results.
Something so great that it forms the roots of life on eath, made the thing under your microscope.
The lessons of biology carry over into real life, a new understanding of life.


## Building blocks: organic chemistry

**Firststuffs.**
Elements combine to form *bulkbits* (molecules) and *bindings* (compounds).
The elements are called the first stuff because they're *uncleftish.*
You can't divide them into smaller parts, unlike how a horse's cleft hoof is split in the middle.

All the elements like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and sulphur combine as molecules.
The way the bits are arranged, and the number of elements in them, changes how the molecules act.
For example, many different foodstuffs are only made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen:

- the simple sugars in honey, fruit, chocolate cake, and other sweet things;
- the complex sugars in whole grains, vegetables, beans, nuts, and seeds;
- the fats in eggs, butter, and milk; certain fruits like olives and avocados; and meat and nuts;
- the protein that normally comes with fatty foods and certain legumes like beans.[^food1992]

**Bulkbits.**
If you think about it, those three elements are responsible for all family dinners ever.
But that's not all there is to having a healthy diet of whole foods.

Eating many different foods gives you different vitamins and minerals as well.
Those are other more rare and special molecules, like antioxidants and melanins,
and Vitamin C to fight scurvy and Vitamin A for healthy skin.

Every plant and animal makes its own chemical molecules to help it survive and bear children.
That avocado may be delicious and nutritious, but it needs to be healthy so a new tree can grow from it.

The very organism is beholden to the cells that comprise it, tireless biochemistry machines buzzing with energy.

**Bindings.**
Most molecules are found stitched together in complex patterns called polymer chains.
These compounds are where life's action really happens:
the very complex and unique sugars in plant cell walls can have different effects as your body breaks them down.
Also, the cells can make their own compounds for many different reasons such as

- turning sunlight or food into nutrients,
- using the nutrients to grow or heal injuries,
- attacking competitors or removing parasites,
- sexually reproducing to continue the line.

Mushrooms are where my personal interest lies.
Some species make powerful compounds that help your immune system learn new ways to fight disease.
Every drug, natural or manmade, is a chemical compound;
there are different kinds of drugs such as alkaloids, steroids, hormones, etc.

Drugs affect your body by fitting into specially shaped slots in the cell membrane or wall called receptors.
When a drug fits into a receptor is causes the cell to produce molecules that change which genes are active.
The change in gene expression lets the cell make new compounds to respond to the drug's chemical message.


## Common firststuffs's chemical properties

**Waterstuff.**
Hydrogen (H) is the lightest and most plentiful element and it forms the basis of all matter.
A colorless, odorless, ubiquitous gas that easily reacts with other elements.

It's called *waterstuff* because it provides the spark needed to make water in a great explosion.
Water is biochemistry's natural medium: almost every reaction happens in an aqueous environment.

Many cultures have concepts for pneuma, chakra, spirit, life energy, and similar terms.
Hydrogen is the closest thing to this we can observe: an element that sparks everything.

Hydrogen and helium are called *sunstuff* because stars, cosmic engines of pure energy, are made of them.

**Sourstuff.**
Oxygen (O) is another abundant gas and the other part of water.
It's called *sourstuff* because of its chemical effects:
not only do bacteria and yeast make sour-tasting compounds when oxygen is available,
but also dangerous substances like bleach, vitriol, permanganate, and potassium nitrare rely on it.

These are the extremes of wet and dry sourness: acid that can eat your skin, and powders that can explode.
The sourness spectrum is less dangerous in the shallow end.
The microbes in sauerkraut make lactic acid, and oxidizers are usually acids.
There's a field of chemistry called redox chemistry that studies what happens when oxygen-based compounds trade electrons.

For our purposes, however, the sourness in sauerkraut, kimchi, yoghurt, sourdough bread, etc., comes from lactic acid fermentation.
All this good and healthy food relies on oxygen or *sourstuff* to make the necessary molecules.

**Coalstuff.**
Carbon (C) is the main solid element of biochemistry.
It forms the backbone of polymer chains and lets them bind together.
This gives compounds the power to do things like make cell walls.

There's a hypothetical field of biochemistry concerned with alternate life possibilities.
Silicon (Si) or *flintstuff,* another element similar to carbon, is one possibility with proof on earth.

Silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) is the main component of quartz, sand, and glass.
Also, diatoms use it to form beautiful cell walls and spinach uses it to deter predators.
That's why your teeth feel raw after eating spinach: tiny glass particles embedded in the leaves.

Carbon comes in different forms such as graphite and diamonds.
It's also the main component of coal, peat, oil, and methane.
Other related elements include metals like

- Titanium (Ti) or *germanstuff,* first purified by Germans and used in military and aerospace engineering;
- Tin (Sn), used to solder things together and to make special alloys such as pewter and bronze; and
- Lead (Pb), a toxic metal that's very dense and can be alloyed with antimony to shield against radiation.

**Stonestuff.**
These are the elements in Group 1 of the periodic table, the alkali metals.
They're usually soft, shiny metals that easily react with oxygen and other elements.
Because of this, they tarnish easily.
Compared to gold, which never tarnishes unless it's alloyed with a reactive metal like copper.

- Lithium (Li) or *stonestuff,* used in mood stabilizing drugs
- Sodium (Na) or *glasswortstuff;* glasswort plant ashes were used in glassmaking
- Potassium (K) or *potashstuff;* potash is plant ashes and usually used in fertilizer
- Rubidium (Rb) or *redstuff,* used to give fireworks a red or purple color
- Caesium (Cs) or *bluegraystuff,* used in atomic clocks and vacuum electronics


**Nitrogeen.**
`todo:`
Make a *stuff* name for nitrogen and briefly explain how it's an alternate food source for `chemo` `trophs` and generally smelly processes.
Continue the thread started in **Coalstuff** about methane and peat.


## Activity: making sauerkraut

`todo:`
Write a short overview in simple English of the lactate dehydrogenase pathway.
Also include a recipe for sprout kraut with tumeric and a note that most vegetables are fermentable.
Throw it away if moldy, be clean when you make it, basic mother-and-child kitchen activity stuff.
